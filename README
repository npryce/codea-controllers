A small library of composable multi-touch controllers for Codea that implement
various game control mechanisms.

A controller translates touch events into higher level callbacks to control
game objects.

The library includes a virtual analogue joystick with central dead-zone, a catapult
style interaction for launching projectiles, and tap interpreters that can be used
as fire or jump buttons.

Controllers can be composed. A single statement can define a complex control scheme,
such as used in a dual-stick shooter, or a shared-screen multiplayer game, or a 
shared-screen multiplayer dual-stick shooter!

To use, just copy the contents of Controllers.lua into your Codea project and delete
the controller classes you don't want to use.
