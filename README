A small library of composable multi-touch controllers for Codea that implement
various game control mechanisms.

A controller translates touch events into higher level callbacks to control
game objects.

The library includes an analogue joystick and slider with central dead-zone, a catapult
style interaction for launching projectiles, and tap interpreters that can be used
as fire or jump buttons.

Controllers can be composed. A single statement can define a complex control scheme,
such as used in a dual-stick shooter, or a shared-screen multiplayer game, or a 
shared-screen multiplayer dual-stick shooter!

Unfortunately, because Apple restrict what apps on iOS can do, you can now longer 
download the code directly into Codea.  You'll have to copy and paste from the GitHub
code browser.
